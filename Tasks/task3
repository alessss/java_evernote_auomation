Bug #1
User receives the same verification code
1. Open Videoslots.com
2. Type correct email and phone number and submit data.
3. Try to login using credentials entered.
4. On additional info tab click Resend code button
Actual result: User receives the same code
Expected: User should receive another code after clicking Resend code button.

This bug is critical, because it affects security. Code should be valid only for certain perio of time.

Bug #2.
User's phone is not validated
1. Open Videoslots.com
2. Select country
3. Type wrong phone number, and correct email
4. Activate app through email code
Result: User's phone is not validated.
Expected: User's phone should be validated

Since not all countries listed in countries dropdown, it means that users from the countries not in the list shouldn't
be able to register. I was able to register only using email, but I think that Estoniia is not in the list o countries
where videoslots operate. Allowing registration for users from such countries, can cause legal problems.
